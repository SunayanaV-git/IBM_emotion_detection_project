# IBM Emotion Detection Project 
A small practice project developed as part of the **IBM "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask"** course on Coursera.

It takes text input from the user and predicts emotions such as *anger, joy, sadness, fear,* and *disgust* using an external API.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask  
- HTML / CSS  
- Emotion Detection API (IBM Watson-based)

>  Note: This project was developed and tested inside the IBM Skills Network IDE provided in the Coursera course.  
> The Emotion Detection API endpoint may not be accessible outside that environment.  
> If you run this locally, the Flask app will start, but the API calls may not return results unless you have access to the same service.
